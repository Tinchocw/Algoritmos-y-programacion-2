# TP2 - Algorithm 2

## Overview

This project is the second practical work (TP2) for the Algorithm 2 course. The main purpose is the implementation of a doubly linked list to manage the a refugy of animals, taking advantage of the properties of the doubly linked list, such as the possibility of inserting and removing elements in the middle of the list.

Also the project implements the concept of classes and inheritance in C++.
